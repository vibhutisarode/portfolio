# Resume Download

This folder should contain your resume file named `resume.pdf` for the download feature to work.

## Instructions:
1. Add your actual resume as `resume.pdf` in the `public` folder
2. The download button in the Hero section will link to `/resume.pdf`
3. Make sure the file is properly formatted and up-to-date

## Alternative:
If you prefer to link to an external resume (like Google Drive), update the href in:
- `src/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx` (line with Download Resume button)
